    "## Project Topic\n",
    "This project focuses on developing an automated email spam detection system using supervised machine learning techniques. We will implement and compare two different classification algorithms, specifically Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to classify emails as either spam or legitimate (ham) based on their text content. This represents a clear classification problem in the realm of supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system will learn from a labeled dataset of emails obtained from Kaggle, where each email is already marked as either spam or ham. This is a supervised learning problem because the data is already labeled for us. By analyzing patterns in the text of known spam and ham emails, our models will learn to identify characteristics that distinguish between the two categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goals and Importance\n",
    "Email remains one of the most crucial tools for digital communication, especially in business settings, but there is a growing distrust of emails and businesses are constantly fighting to filter spam emails. According to Statista, nearly half of all emails worldwide are spam, creating a significant barrier to effective communication and eroding user trust in email systems. This flood of unwanted messages not only wastes time and resources but also poses security risks through phishing attempts and malicious content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this project, I aim to address this challenge by developing an effective spam detection system. By comparing Random Forest and SVM classifiers, I hope to identify reliable approaches for automatically filtering unwanted emails. This work will contribute to the broader effort of making email a more reliable and trustworthy communication medium."
